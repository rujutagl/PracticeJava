weakness:

Example 1 : “I’m naturally shy. From high school and into my early professional interactions, it prevented me from speaking up .
Now (overcoming your weakness) I am learning practical skills around leading discussions and sharing diverse perspectives.

Example 4: “By default i believe that I can solve any problem on my own. This works well in some situations,
but in many cases, I need the help of others to overcome factors beyond my control.
Now I’ve been training myself to take a step back before diving into problem-solving mode and identify
people or groups that can be resources to me.”

Strength

Debugging i feel is my greatest strength. I find myself reaching to a problem much quicker while debugging an issue.
Of course that comes with experience but overall so far in my career i felt i m comfortable debugging.
